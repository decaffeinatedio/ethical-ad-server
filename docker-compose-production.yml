# Docker Compose Production Setup
#
# You probably will not use this (in whole anyway) in production.
# Instead you will use a combination of fully managed services
# such as managed Redis or managed Postgres or even a fully
# managed environment such as Heroku or Elastic Beanstalk.
#
# The following will need to be created for this environment to work:
# - ./.envs/production/
